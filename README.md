# Sonic Adventure 2 Archipelago Slot QuickSwitcher

This is a Godot Engine application designed to make switching between Archipelago slots for SA2 easier. If you've stumbled upon this and don't know what Archipelago is, have a link: https://archipelago.gg.

The main use case is for someone with multiple simultanious SA2 slots active at once. For example, taking more than one SA2 slot in an async, or having an SA2 slot in an async and then playing SA2 in a sync game. On a desktop or laptop, this isn't that big of a deal to change, but on the Steam Deck it's a bit annoying. 

Current Status: Complete, all planned features have been implemented.

It also features a tabbed layout, mainly intended for use on the Steam Deck (where the keyboard takes up quite a bit of space):
